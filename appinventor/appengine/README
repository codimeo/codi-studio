The war build should not be used as is. It should be copied to an external folder
and executed from there.

$ cp build/war -R <path_to_codi-server>

To execute then issue the following, provdided that appengine dev_server is added
to the path environment

$ dev_appserver.sh -p 8888 -a 0.0.0.0 <path_to_codi-server>

For the buildserver as daemon service, please refer to appinventor/misc/buildserver/README
